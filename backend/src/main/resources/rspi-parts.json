It consists of a pair of contacts on ferrous metal reeds in a hermetically sealed glass envelope. There are two types of reed switches: 'normally open' reed switches and 'normally closed' reed switches. The metal reeds on a normally open switch stay open when there is no magnet near the switch. In the presence of a magnetic field, the contacts of a normally-open reed switch will close. A normally-closed reed switch is closed when it is not near a magnet; as a magnet is brought close to it, a normally-closed switch will open.",
